### This graph takes the number of goals scored each year and divides it by the number of matches played to 
###return the average goals per match for each year in World Cup History ##
### Was unable to figure out how to set the X- Axis to the year so left if as the index so I redid converted things to a series of arrays
###and returned them this way ###
